# Solving-Systems-of-ODEs
This was a lab (4) I coded from scratch for a second year ordinary differential equations course. It consists of 1 separate function file (solvesystem_wangrush.m), which solve systems of ODEs. The lab4_wangrush file contain exercises I've written that plot and compare solutions to ODEs under each method.
